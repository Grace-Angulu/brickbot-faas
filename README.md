# brickbot-faas

A collection of function configs that give functionality to brickbot. These are being run using OpenFaaS. They're on Github for redundancy but also for folks to have a look at.

There are lots of resources out there for OpenFaaS, I think [this blog](https://medium.com/@thomas.shaw78/bash-functions-as-a-service-b4033bc1ee97) is one of the best to get started with.
